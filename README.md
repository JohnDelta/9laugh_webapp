# 9laugh_webapp

Web application for the 9laugh project

9laugh's back-end restfull API can be found [here](https://github.com/JohnDelta/9laugh_api)

## About
9laugh is an entertaining web platform in which users upload and share content. Other users can see the content and comment/like it. The content can be created by the users themselves or by other external sources. For this project I:
- Utilized Spring boot and developed RESTfull API
controllers to handle users'requests
- Followed API security principles and implemented JWT
authorization
- Applied JPA and Hibernate to manage the relational
MySQL database and models
- Developed a web application using React to handle the
users'views
